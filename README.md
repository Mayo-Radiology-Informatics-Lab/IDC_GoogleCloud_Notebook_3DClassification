# IDC_GoogleCloud_Notebook_3DClassification

This repository includes a sample Google Cloud notebook that shows how to train a 3D classification model on Imaging Data Commons (IDC) buckets. 
Here are what I have covered in this notebook:

* How to connect to IDC buckets.
* How to retrieve the DICOMs metadata from IDC using BigQuery commands.
* How to download DICOMs from IDC.
* How to change DICOMs to NIFTIs in the clouds.
* How to pre-process data and train a 3D model on it using MONAI and Pytorch.

This notebook has been developed in the Radiology Informatics Laboratory at Mayo Clinic (MN), USA.
